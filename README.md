# BioBrick2Genbank
I created [this tool](http://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Tools/GenBank) in 2010 as a small part of the [Cambridge iGEM team](http://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge)'s work. It's been used about 558,511 times since then. Putting it on GitHub since this is where code lives now.

I'm not very up to date on the Synbio world anymore so feel free to submit PRs that incorporate new tags if there are any.
